The findings indicate that ATO-based coatings offer superior stability and protection, particularly in pressure-sensitive adhesives (PSAs) used for LCD polarizers, where they effectively prevent static discharge. This is highly relevant for the coatings industry as it provides a potential solution to the widespread issue of replacing PFAS in various applications, ensuring compliance with new regulations while maintaining or even improving product performance.",

This initiative aims to establish a sustainability framework to help coatings manufacturers in green building certifications, provide the industry with influence in the standard's development, and clarify the sustainable attributes of architectural coatings. After a successful balloting process in May 2022 and subsequent amendments approved in October 2022, the program's publication was put on hold for further review. ACA formed a task force, which compiled over ten pages of proposed amendments by early 2024. A key concern is the potential conflict with the anticipated LEED Version 5, leading ACA to request a delay in NSF 498's publication for a detailed analysis. A major point of discussion within the program's Joint Committee is whether to narrow its focus to a product standard by removing social responsibility chapters or to maintain its broader sustainability scope. The program's status was pending further review and action as of early 2024.",
