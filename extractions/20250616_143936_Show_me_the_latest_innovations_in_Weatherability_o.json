According to Professor Samiul Amin of the University of Miami, this technology helps formulators optimize product characteristics like viscosity and rheology, which are critical for performance. His company, FastFormulator Inc., uses a 'Chemical Intelligence' model that combines AI with formulation science to develop new products, such as sustainable and biodegradable inks. The system assists in selecting the right combination of novel bio-based materials from numerous suppliers to meet specific performance expectations. Beyond formulation, AI can also monitor regulatory changes, suggest compliant substitute ingredients, and track intellectual property and patents. Despite the potential to drastically shorten time-to-market and foster innovation, industry adoption remains slow, with only about 6% of large companies reportedly having implemented AI, partly due to a cultural resistance to change. The technology is presented as a tool to enhance human productivity, not replace it, by automating repetitive tasks and allowing formulators to focus on innovation.",
