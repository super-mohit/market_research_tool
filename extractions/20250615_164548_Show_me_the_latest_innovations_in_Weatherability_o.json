        "summary": "China, the largest global market for architectural paint and coatings, is facing a slowdown due to a crisis in its construction sector. The explosive growth of the architectural coatings sub-segment has been halted in the last three years. The property sector's downturn, exemplified by heavily indebted developers like Evergrande and a significant drop in sales for giants like Country Garden, has dampened the demand for architectural coatings in 2023 and is expected to lead to sluggish growth in the coming years. Demand from new constructions has been sluggish, and even the repainting sub-segment is affected by consumers tightening their spending amidst economic uncertainty. The Chinese architectural coatings industry saw a dip in production volume in 2022 and is expected to decline further in 2023. Despite the downturn, market consolidation continues, with AkzoNobel acquiring Sherwin-Williams' Chinese decorative paints business to expand its presence in the country.",
