        "summary": "The American Coatings Association (ACA) published its third Technology Roadmap in February 2024, focusing on enhancing the durability and water resistance of waterborne coatings. The report stems from industry-led discussions aimed at identifying key research areas. It notes that tightening regulations on Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) and a growing focus on sustainability are driving increased demand for waterborne systems. The roadmap outlines several persistent technical challenges, including managing hydrophilicity, improving film formation under various environmental conditions, extending 'open time' for application, preventing 'flash rust' on metal substrates, and ensuring freeze-thaw stability. To address these issues, the report offers seven core recommendations. Key suggestions include the development of more accurate, non-destructive testing methods to better predict real-world performance; research into higher crosslink density and two-component (2K) waterborne systems for more demanding applications; and the pursuit of greater system robustness through novel resins, additives, and surfactants. The roadmap also advocates for updating product specifications to be performance-based rather than chemistry-specific, and calls for better training and awareness programs to promote proper application and share success stories.",

Participants included executives from AkzoNobel, BASF, Benjamin Moore, Berger Paints, Hempel, HMG Paints, Mäder Group, Sinteplast, and Vitex. The consensus on 2024 was a year of mixed market conditions and varied regional performance, with geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic instability cited as key challenges. For instance, AkzoNobel saw solid growth despite weakness in China's decorative paint market, while Berger Paints reported high single-digit volume growth. Looking to 2025, most companies are not expecting a significant market rebound and are focusing on strategies like cost efficiency, operational improvements, and portfolio management. Key growth opportunities identified include marine and powder coatings (AkzoNobel), infrastructure and energy sectors (Hempel), construction chemicals (Berger Paints), and water-based technologies (HMG Paints). A major recurring theme was the increasing demand for sustainable and eco-friendly solutions. R&D efforts are heavily focused on this area, with companies developing coatings for green energy applications like EV batteries, low-bake systems, and integrating bio-based or recycled raw materials to meet customer and regulatory demands for a reduced environmental footprint.",
