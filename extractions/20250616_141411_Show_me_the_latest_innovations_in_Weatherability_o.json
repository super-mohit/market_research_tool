As the industry shifts towards near-zero VOC formulations, these additives offer a highly efficient solution for performance enhancement. The article explains how modifying the structure of polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) molecules, for example through polyether modifications, allows for the creation of surface control agents that significantly lower surface tension. This improves substrate wetting and provides a range of benefits without the negative environmental impact of traditional chemistries. Key findings demonstrate that specific siloxane additives can markedly improve early block resistance, stain resistance, and scuff resistance, particularly in higher pigment volume concentration (PVC) systems. The study utilized commercial products from Evonik's TEGO¬Æ Glide and TEGO¬Æ Phobe lines to showcase these improvements in various coating properties.",

These technologies serve as advanced tools that can drastically reduce the time and resources required for formulation. For instance, instead of conducting hundreds of experiments to optimize a new formulation, AI can narrow the possibilities down to as few as five or ten, providing an optimized starting point. Professor Samiul Amin from the University of Miami, co-founder of FastFormulator Inc., highlights that AI can be used to develop novel sustainable and biodegradable formulations by rapidly analyzing countless combinations of new bio-based materials to meet performance expectations. Beyond formulation, AI systems can monitor evolving regulatory and compliance changes in real-time, suggesting substitutes for newly restricted materials. They can also track intellectual property and patents to provide a competitive edge. While industry adoption remains slow, with a recent study showing only 6% of large companies have integrated AI, the technology is presented not as a replacement for human expertise but as a powerful tool to enhance productivity and allow formulators to focus on innovation.",

Key drivers include a stabilizing supply chain and strong demand from the architectural and industrial coatings sectors. A significant trend is the shift towards sustainability and high-performance pigments (HPP). Companies are adapting to new regulations, such as those concerning PFAS, which has increased demand for highly-engineered inorganic pigments in applications like cookware. For example, Shepherd Color is highlighting its FDA-compliant CICP pigments. Trust Chem announced the opening of a new plant in China to supply HPP and azo pigments. However, the industry faces regulatory headwinds in the U.S. The Color Pigments Manufacturers Association (CPMA) has voiced concerns over costly regulations, specifically citing the EPA's proposed draft rule for CI Pigment Violet 29, published on December 20, 2024. Sustainability remains a major focus, particularly in Europe, with companies pursuing EcoVadis ratings and developing eco-friendly products like IR reflective pigments to improve energy efficiency.",

        "summary": "California's South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) has scheduled a public hearing for June 6 to consider Proposed Amended Rule 1171, which governs solvent cleaning operations. The district has released the draft rule language and staff report for public review. These amendments could have a significant impact on coatings manufacturers and users who rely on solvent-based cleaning processes, potentially requiring changes in materials, equipment, or procedures to comply with new emissions standards.

        "summary": "The American Coatings Association (ACA) released a statement expressing concern over new tariffs imposed on Canada, Mexico, and China. The ACA argues that these tariffs will disrupt supply chains and increase production costs for the paint and coatings industry. As these countries are major trading partners, the financial impact is expected to ripple through to essential consumer products that rely on coatings, including automotive parts, aerospace applications, food production equipment, and medical devices. The statement highlights the potential for these trade policies to negatively affect both manufacturers and consumers.",

The changes are intended to create a more consistent regulatory framework by aligning the national rule with the aerosol coatings rule established by the California Air Resources Board (CARB). This harmonization is expected to benefit aerosol coatings manufacturers by streamlining compliance obligations and reducing the complexity of navigating different state and federal regulations, thereby simplifying product distribution across the United States.",
