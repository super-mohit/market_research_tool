The article explores how formulating knowledge from UV cationic coatings can be applied to thermally cured systems, with some differences, such as the tolerance for higher application viscosities in non-sprayed UV coatings. The addition of caprolactone polyols is shown to be effective in both solvent-based and UV-cured coatings, and in thermally cured coatings, water can be used as a zero VOC diluent.",
