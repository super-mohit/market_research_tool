### **Sub-Report: Coatings Industry Innovations and Trends**

#### **1. Key Findings and Insights**

*   Product innovation in the coatings industry is driven by the dual consumer demand for finishes that are both beautiful and durable.
*   Key performance characteristics sought by customers include mildew resistance, scrubbability, impact resistance, and resistance to color fade.
*   Benjamin Moore has released new and reformulated products to meet these demands, including the Regal Select Interior paint, which features proprietary stain-release technology and increased scuff-resistance.
*   For exterior applications, Benjamin Moore's Element Guard is a premium paint formulated to withstand high moisture and harsh weather conditions like wind-driven rain and excessive humidity.
*   The wood coatings market is also driven by innovation, with consumers seeking products that offer long-lasting protection and durability in harsh environments.
*   There is a significant industry shift away from traditional two-component, solventborne polyurethane systems towards waterborne or UV-cured systems to reduce VOC content.
*   The housing market, including existing home sales and new construction, along with consumer confidence, has a significant impact on paint sales. Homeowners are staying in their homes longer and investing more in upkeep, which drives demand for durable products.

#### **2. Emerging Trends and Innovations**

**a. Sustainability**

*   Sustainability is a primary driver of innovation in the coatings industry. The PCI Magazine 2025 editorial calendar has a recurring focus on topics like Sustainability, Waterborne Technology, PFAS Replacements, Low-VOC Technology, and Bio-Based Technology.
*   The industry is actively developing PFAS-free alternatives, such as new antistatic coatings that offer superior stability and protection without using PFAS. Micro Powders has also launched a new PFAS-free texture additive to replace PTFE in powder coatings.
*   Raw material suppliers are creating low-emission coatings, including new iron oxide yellow pigments designed to reduce the carbon footprint of formulations.
*   A key trend for 2025 is the move towards bio-based coatings. The American Coatings Conference in 2024 featured a session dedicated to bio-based materials.
*   European paint companies are actively working to fulfill a "Green Agenda," and major corporations are receiving accolades for their sustainability practices. BASF is now powering its auto OEM coatings operations in China with 100% renewable electricity.
*   Vibrantz is introducing "Pearls," a sustainable, biocide-free solid tinting system with 100% recyclable packaging that extends paint shelf life.

**b. Durability and Weatherability**

*   Innovations in durability include the use of graphene to enhance corrosion resistance and conductivity in coatings.
*   Formulators are developing new water-based Direct-to-Metal (DTM) coatings that enhance adhesion and corrosion resistance.
*   For wood coatings, there is a focus on products that can withstand harsh conditions while maintaining their aesthetic appeal. New products include waterborne wood coatings and advanced coil coating systems.
*   In Europe, field testing has confirmed that controlled-release, encapsulated dry-film preservatives provide long-term protection against fungal and algal growth.

**c. Scuff-Resistance**

*   Benjamin Moore launched Ultra Spec SCUFF-X, described as the industry's first single-component, scuff-resistant interior latex paint designed for high-traffic commercial environments. This product offers the durability of a two-component coating without the associated drawbacks like strong odor and short pot-life.
*   The company's reformulated Regal Select Interior paint also features increased scuff-resistance.
*   A significant challenge for formulators is balancing the soft, tactile feel of certain coatings with the need for mechanical performance properties like scratch and stain resistance. This balance is a key area of research and development, especially for soft-touch coatings used in automotive interiors and consumer electronics.

**d. Digitalization and AI**

*   The coatings industry is exploring the practical applications of AI in areas like R&D, production, and quality control to create "smart paint factories".
*   A new terahertz robotic solution is revolutionizing automotive and aerospace manufacturing by providing coating thickness measurements with precision down to 1 micron, which helps eliminate paint waste.
*   To assist customers, companies are developing digital tools like the Benjamin Moore Color Match Tool, which connects to an app to find paint color matches from any scanned surface.

#### **3. Technical Specs/Data**

*   Benjamin Moore's Element Guard exterior paint is formulated to resist rain as soon as 60 minutes after application and can be applied in low temperatures of 35°F, extending the painting season.
*   Ultra Spec SCUFF-X is a low-VOC, single-component latex paint that is eligible for LEED v4 credit and is available in Matte, Eggshell, and Satin finishes.
*   The PCI April 2025 issue features a new generation of epoxy coatings that deliver fast cure speeds and high flexibility without compromising tensile strength or adhesion. It also highlights UV coatings that can eliminate VOCs while increasing production speed.
*   Vibrantz's Pearls™ technology utilizes a volumetrically dosed tinting system of solid, freeze-dried pigment colorants.

#### **4. Market and Regulatory Context**

*   The coatings market is being influenced by economic factors, including higher interest rates and inflation, which temper existing home sales and reduce discretionary income for DIY projects.
*   Increasingly stringent environmental regulations are a primary driver for innovation, pushing companies to find more eco-friendly solutions. This is particularly evident in the push for PFAS-free alternatives.
*   The market is responding to regulatory demands with new products. The PCI Magazine 2025 editorial calendar shows a clear focus on themes like "PFAS Replacements," "Sustainability," and "Low-VOC Technology".
*   Green building initiatives and certifications, such as LEED v4, are now a primary requirement for most commercial new construction projects, compelling manufacturers to provide products that meet these standards.

#### **5. Conferences and Publications**

*   Numerous conferences are scheduled for 2025, providing platforms for industry discussion and innovation. These include the inaugural Great Lakes Coatings Conference in June, which will prioritize abstracts focused on sustainability, the Coatings Trends & Technologies Summit in September, the Western Coatings Symposium in October, and CHINACOAT 2025 in November.
*   The 2026 American Coatings Show & Conference has also been announced.
*   The March 2025 issue of PCI Magazine focuses on PFAS replacements, architectural coatings, and pigments, making it a key publication for insights on scuff-resistance and sustainability.
*   The April 2025 issue of PCI Magazine explores innovations in special purpose coatings, low-VOC technologies, and advanced resins, covering topics relevant to weatherability and durability.
