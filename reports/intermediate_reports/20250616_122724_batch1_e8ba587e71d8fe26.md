## Batch 1 Intermediate Report

Here is the market intelligence sub-report.

### **Executive Summary**

The coatings industry in the Middle East is demonstrating a significant shift towards sustainability and efficiency, driven by customer demand for greener, user-friendly products. Key innovation is centered in the development of advanced formulations like water-based and polyaspartic systems, supported by new regional R&D facilities, such as IMCD's Dubai laboratory which opened in March 2025. The upcoming Saudi Arabia Coatings Show 2025 is poised to be a key venue for showcasing these emerging trends.

### **Key Technical Findings**

*   **New Formulation Focus:** Technical presentations scheduled for the Saudi Arabia Coatings Show 2025 highlight a focus on advanced coating systems. Topics include the formulation of water-based direct-to-metal (DTM) coatings, water-based 2K epoxy for metal applications, and polyaspartic formulations.
*   **Decorative and Functional Enhancements:** Innovations in decorative paints include the use of functional fillers to optimize high-end finishes and the development of microcement formulations for trendy surfaces. For industrial applications, developments include techniques to increase the jetness of carbon black for inks and coatings.
*   **Construction Chemicals:** The construction sector is seeing advancements in high-quality cementitious tile adhesives.

### **Market Intelligence**

*   **Regional R&D Investment:** IMCD has expanded its presence in the Middle East by opening a new Coatings & Construction laboratory in Dubai in March 2025, aimed at providing advanced formulation support tailored to regional customers.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** Global distributors like IMCD are actively strengthening their regional presence in the Middle East to work more closely with local partners and address specific market needs. The Saudi Arabia Coatings Show, scheduled for May 13-15, 2025 (note: the article contains a date discrepancy, also mentioning 2023), serves as a key platform for companies to connect with partners and showcase innovations.
*   **Customer Demand Patterns:** A 2025-2026 survey of over 150 customers in the Middle East and Africa identified key "megatrends" shaping purchasing decisions: Green & Circular, Healthy Future, and Efficiency. Customers in the Middle East specifically prioritize formulations that are easy to apply and use.

### **Regulatory & Sustainability Context**

*   **Key Sustainability Drivers:** The primary sustainability trends influencing the Middle East market are the reduction of VOC emissions for both indoor and outdoor applications and overall waste reduction.
*   **Green Technology Adoption:** The market shows a strong preference for "smarter and more sustainable solutions." This is reflected in the technical focus on water-based formulations for metal applications, which typically offer a lower VOC profile compared to traditional solvent-borne systems.

### **Emerging Trends & Future Outlook**

*   **Focus on Water-Based Systems:** The industry is heavily trending towards water-based technologies for industrial applications, such as DTM and 2K epoxy coatings, signaling a move away from solvent-based systems to meet sustainability demands.
*   **High-Performance Formulations:** Polyaspartic coatings are an area of active development, indicating a demand for faster curing, highly durable systems.
*   **Industry Collaboration:** Companies are emphasizing closer collaboration with customers to tackle formulation challenges and develop solutions that align with evolving market demands for efficiency and sustainability.
*   **Information Gaps:** Data regarding the weatherability of decorative coatings and specific conferences or patents discussing scuff-resistance was not available in the provided sources. The accessible source primarily focused on the Middle East market.
