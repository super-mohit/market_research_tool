### Coatings Market Sub-Report: Durability, Sustainability, and Performance

This report details key findings and trends in the coatings industry, with a focus on weatherability, sustainability, and scuff-resistance, based on the provided data sources.

#### **1. Key Findings and Insights**

*   **Market Resilience and Growth:** Despite recent supply chain disruptions and economic headwinds, the industrial and architectural coatings markets are showing signs of recovery and growth. The global industrial coatings market was valued at $87.19 billion in 2022 and is projected to grow. The architectural coatings segment, which makes up about 60% of the U.S. market by volume, saw strong growth in 2020 and 2021, partly driven by a pandemic-related surge in DIY home projects.
*   **Performance is Paramount:** End-users prioritize coatings that offer a combination of durability, efficiency, and enhanced aesthetics. For interior coatings, key properties include hide, durability, and ease of application. In the industrial sector, customers seek faster manufacturing processes, long-lasting durability, and robust protection against corrosion and weather.
*   **Advanced Formulations:** Companies are launching advanced formulations to meet specific performance demands. Dunn-Edwards introduced DECOGLO, a water-based, urethane-modified acrylic for interiors that provides exceptional hardness, scuff resistance, and chemical resistance. BEHR's DYNASTY™ Interior Paint is marketed as a highly stain-repellent and scuff-resistant coating with one-coat hide.
*   **Weatherability Testing is Crucial:** Understanding how coatings perform in real-world conditions is vital for product development and commercial success. Extensive exterior exposure testing, which monitors properties like gloss retention, chalking, cracking, and dirt pickup, is essential to validate the long-term durability of coatings. Companies utilize global testing sites to evaluate performance across various climates, from temperate to tropical and coastal.

#### **2. Emerging Trends and Innovations**

*   **Sustainability as a Core Driver:** Sustainability is a dominant trend influencing product development across all segments. Companies are focusing on lowering environmental impact through various strategies:
    *   **Low/Zero VOC:** The shift from solvent-based to waterborne and powder coatings continues to accelerate due to regulatory pressure and consumer demand. Wanhua Chemical is developing "zero" SVOC (semi-volatile organic compounds) technology and low-viscosity hardeners to reduce VOC emissions.
    *   **Bio-based and Recycled Content:** Innovation is occurring in the use of sustainable raw materials. Wanhua Chemical has developed a bio-based PDI (pentamethylene diisocyanate) from biomass. Sherwin-Williams' Powdura ECO powder coatings use post-consumer recycled plastic (rPET) as a raw material, reducing plastic waste and CO2 emissions. Allnex has launched its ECOWISE CHOICE portfolio, which includes products with renewable or recycled content for building and decorative applications.
    *   **Health and Hygiene:** The pandemic increased demand for coatings with antimicrobial and antiviral properties. PPG developed Copper Armor™ paint, which is registered with the EPA and proven to kill 99.9% of certain bacteria and viruses on the painted surface.
*   **Technological Advancement in Testing:** The science of evaluating weatherability is advancing through technology. Automated imaging systems like Dow's eXposure Vision™ allow for more frequent and precise data collection on how coatings weather over time, analyzing properties like cracking and color retention.
*   **Powder Coatings on the Rise:** Powder coatings are identified as a key growth area, driven by their sustainability advantages and performance characteristics. PPG has made strategic acquisitions and expanded production to grow its powder coatings capacity.

#### **3. Technical Specs and Data**

*   **Weathering Test Methods:** To accelerate testing, coatings are often exposed facing south at a 45° angle, which increases radiation intensity and moisture cycling, leading to faster deterioration compared to vertical exposures. This method is used to quickly assess gloss and color retention, as well as cracking and adhesion over wood.
*   **Substrate Impact:** The substrate significantly impacts coating durability. Yellow pine is often used in testing because its dimensional instability when exposed to moisture makes it a good substrate for observing early cracking failures. To simulate real-world applications, tests are also conducted on previously painted and chalked surfaces to evaluate adhesion.
*   **Formulation Data:** Wanhua Chemical's bio-based PDI has a bio-based carbon content of over 71%. Their high-biobased content wood furniture coating emulsion, Lacper® 4605, has broken through previous technical barriers for biobased content.

#### **4. Market and Regulatory Context**

*   **Global Regulatory Pressure:** The coatings industry is navigating a complex and evolving global regulatory landscape.
    *   Mexico is proposing new VOC limits for architectural coatings consistent with California's 2019 AIM Suggested Control Measure.
    *   The EU's "Chemicals Strategy for Sustainability" is leading to significant changes in chemical management, including new hazard classes that may trigger product restrictions.
    *   Regulators are increasing scrutiny on biocides and PFAS, with the EU restricting PFOA and PFAS use. BYK has announced it will stop supplying PFAS-containing additives by the end of 2025.
*   **Industry Collaboration and Standards:** The World Coatings Council (WCC) provides a forum for the global industry to address international issues. The WCC is developing a "Sustainability Report for the Global Coatings Industry" aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals and is working with the Lead Paint Alliance to establish restrictions on lead in paint globally.
*   **Conferences and Knowledge Sharing:** Industry conferences are key venues for discussing new technologies and trends. The Powder Coating 2024 Technical Conference sought presentations on new technologies, raw materials, and improving efficiency. Calls for papers have been issued for the Pacific Coatings Show 2025 and the Waterborne Symposium 2025, indicating active and ongoing research in these areas.
