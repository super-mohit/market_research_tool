## Batch 0 Intermediate Report

Here is the comprehensive market intelligence sub-report.

### **Executive Summary**

The global coatings industry is experiencing a significant shift towards sustainability and high-performance, driven by stringent regulations and evolving consumer demands. The market is projected to grow from $213.77 billion in 2024 to $278.38 billion by 2030, with key growth in waterborne, powder, and bio-based coatings. Key innovations are focused on enhancing the durability and weatherability of decorative coatings and developing sustainable, PFAS-free alternatives for industrial applications, with a notable rise in the use of AI and advanced testing methodologies to accelerate R&D.

### **Key Technical Findings**

*   **Innovations in Scuff-Resistance:** Behr's BEHR DYNASTY line is highlighted as its most stain-repellent and scuff-resistant, one-coat-hide paint, having been ranked number one by a leading consumer publication for recommended interior paints.
*   **Advancements in Waterborne Coatings:** The American Coatings Association's February 2024 roadmap emphasizes the need for improving the durability and water resistance of waterborne coatings. Key research areas include developing higher crosslink density and two-component (2K) waterborne systems to enhance performance in more extreme environments. Innovations in resin technology, such as self-crosslinking acrylics, polyurethane dispersions (PUDs), and epoxy polymers, are crucial for improving weather resistance, chemical and abrasion resistance, and adhesion. A next-generation acrylic-urethane dispersion has been developed for architectural primers and topcoats, offering excellent adhesion, ultra-blocking characteristics, and superior resistance to water and hand oils in low-VOC formulations.
*   **Weatherability and Durability Testing:** There is a recognized need for improved test methods for waterborne coatings, including non-destructive tests and weathering tests that better predict real-world performance, especially under seasonal changes. Advanced viscometry techniques, such as oscillatory viscometry and rheology profiling, are being used for comprehensive characterization of flow properties and to predict coating performance under varying conditions.
*   **Sustainable Formulations:** AkzoNobel has launched a new wood coating with 20% bio-based content in February 2025. Evonik has also launched mass-balanced products for coatings and inks in March 2025. There is ongoing development of high-renewable, oil-modified polyurethane dispersions for sustainable wood coatings.

### **Market Intelligence**

*   **Market Size and Growth:** The global paints and coatings market was valued at $213.77 billion in 2024 and is projected to reach $278.38 billion by 2030. The architectural coatings market, the largest segment, was estimated at approximately $85 billion in 2023. The U.S. coatings additives market is projected to grow from $8.72 billion in 2024 to $11.04 billion by 2029. The green buildings market saw a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 9.4% from 2023 to 2024.
*   **Competitive Landscape:** In a significant industry move, PPG sold its North American and Canadian architectural coatings division to American Industrial Partners (AIP), which has been renamed The Pittsburgh Paints Company. Masco Corp. reported net sales of $3.125 billion for paints and coatings in 2023, a decrease from $3.428 billion in 2021.
*   **Customer Demand Patterns:** There is a strong trend towards renovations and DIY projects over new construction, driving demand for high-quality, durable, and user-friendly paint products. Consumers are increasingly prioritizing low and zero-VOC coatings for better indoor air quality and are showing more interest in product transparency, such as Environmental Product Declarations (EPDs) and Health Product Declarations (HPDs).

### **Regulatory & Sustainability Context**

*   **PFAS Replacement:** A major issue for the additives market in 2025 will be the discontinuation of PTFE-based additive powders. The industry is actively developing and promoting PFAS-free alternatives to meet regulatory requirements, with a focus on maintaining performance in areas like surface slip, abrasion resistance, and anti-block properties. The Coatings Trends & Technologies Summit in September 2025 will feature multiple presentations on creating PFAS-free solutions and replacing "forever chemicals" with alternatives like organo-siloxane surfactants.
*   **Sustainability Initiatives:** AkzoNobel is embracing circularity by reusing industrial residue to make paint and aims to cut its carbon footprint by 50% across the construction value chain by 2030. The company is also focusing on waterborne coatings and electron beam (e-beam) curing for coil coatings to reduce VOC emissions and energy consumption. BASF has partnered with Li Auto for sustainability and digitalization. Munzing is developing a new portfolio of additives based on bio-renewable raw materials that are PTFE-free, mineral oil-free, and free of microplastics.
*   **New Environmental Regulations:** The growing focus on sustainability and tightening restrictions on volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are prompting increased reliance and use of waterborne coatings. Regulatory restrictions in California, Europe, and China have spurred innovation in developing new, low-VOC coatings.

### **Emerging Trends & Future Outlook**

*   **R&D and Pipeline Innovations:** The September 2025 Coatings Trends & Technologies Summit agenda highlights a strong focus on bio-based technologies, with presentations on high-renewable PUDs for wood coatings and the use of U.S. soybean oil in sustainable formulations. There is also significant research into "smart" corrosion protection, cure-on-demand technologies like frontal polymerization, and sustainable laser technology for the coatings industry. The use of AI in coatings innovation is a key theme, with panel discussions on real-world successes and leveraging Generative AI for additive development.
*   **Industry Partnerships and Acquisitions:** Sudarshan Chemical completed its acquisition of the Heubach Group in March 2025.
*   **Market Disruptions and Opportunities:** The shift away from PTFE and other PFAS chemicals is a major disruption creating opportunities for new, innovative additives. The industry faces a shortage of skilled formulators, which companies like Munzing are addressing by building large, experienced chemistry teams to assist customers. There is a growing focus on circularity and the use of bio-based and renewable raw materials, which is driving R&D in alternatives to fossil fuel-derived ingredients.
