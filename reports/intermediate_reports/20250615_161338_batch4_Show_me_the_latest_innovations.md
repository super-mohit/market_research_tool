## Batch 4 Intermediate Report

### **Market Research Sub-Report: Coatings Industry**

#### **Key Findings and Insights**

*   Sustainability is no longer a niche but a core driver of innovation and business strategy in the coatings industry. Companies are increasingly focusing on sustainable practices, not just to meet regulatory requirements but also to gain a competitive advantage.
*   The demand for durable and weather-resistant coatings remains high, with a focus on developing products that can withstand harsh environmental conditions. The durability of coatings against environmental stresses like sunlight, water, and temperature changes is a critical property for exterior applications.
*   Collaboration across the value chain is essential for achieving sustainability goals. By working together, suppliers, manufacturers, and customers can develop and implement more sustainable solutions.
*   There is a growing market for specialty coatings, such as those with antimicrobial properties. The antimicrobial coating market is projected to reach significant growth, indicating a rising demand for coatings that offer protection against microbes.

#### **Emerging Trends and Innovations**

*   **Sustainability-driven Innovations:**
    *   Sherwin-Williams has developed Powdura® ECO powder coatings, which incorporate up to 25% post-consumer recycled plastic. This innovation is estimated to reduce carbon dioxide equivalent by 16-20% compared to traditional polyester formulas.
    *   Nature Coatings has introduced BioBlack™ pigments, which are 100% bio-based, non-toxic, and carbon-negative alternatives to petroleum-derived carbon black pigments. These pigments are made from FSC-certified and recycled wood waste.
    *   PPG has collaborated with Steelcase to create recycled coatings from powder coatings waste, reducing environmental impact and waste handling fees for the customer.
*   **Enhanced Durability and Weatherability:**
    *   Bomar is developing advanced performance oligomers for energy-cure applications with properties like weatherability, abrasion resistance, and toughness.
    *   Sherwin-Williams has introduced Duraspar™ Industrial Performance (IP) liquid coating with automotive-quality aesthetics and industrial durability. They also offer Powdura® OneCure, a single-cure primer and topcoat system for enhanced edge protection and corrosion resistance.
*   **Scuff-Resistance and Interior Coatings:**
    *   AkzoNobel has launched Dulux EasyCare+ with Scuff Resist technology, which forms a durable matt coating with high mechanical strength to resist scuffs and stains. The technology uses micro-spherical fillers to create a smooth and resistant coating structure.
    *   Dutch Boy® Paints has introduced an improved Platinum® Plus paint with a new Anti-Scuff formula, providing a durable and scrubbable finish for high-traffic areas.

#### **Technical Specs/Data**

*   **Powdura® ECO:** Contains up to 25% post-consumer recycled plastic and offers an estimated 16-20% reduction in carbon dioxide equivalent.
*   **BioBlack™ Pigments:** 100% bio-based, USDA BioPreferred certified, negative carbon footprint, and have less than 0.1 Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs).
*   **Dulux EasyCare+:** Utilizes Scuff Resist technology with micro-spherical fillers for enhanced stain and scuff resistance.
*   **Duraspar™ IP:** A liquid coating that offers high hide and sag resistance for a smooth, high-gloss finish.
*   **Powdura® OneCure:** A patented powder coating technology that combines a single-cure primer and topcoat system.

#### **Market and Regulatory Context**

*   The global architectural metal coatings market is predicted to have an increased emphasis on emerging economies.
*   The antimicrobial coating market is expected to reach $8.82 billion by 2031.
*   Industry events and conferences play a crucial role in disseminating information and showcasing innovations. Upcoming events in 2025 include the Coatings Expo Vietnam, West Africa Coatings Show, and the Western Coatings Show. RadTech 2025 is seeking submissions for its UV&EB Technology & Conference. The American Coatings Association (ACA) has announced the inaugural World Paint and Coatings Week.
